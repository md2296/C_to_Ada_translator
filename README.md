# C_to_Ada_translator
A translator from C to Ada written in C.
This is a very immature project and by no means complete (in fact it may never fully be).

The main program that does the translation is “implementation.c”, the input file is “from_c_program.c” and the output file (generated by running “./a.out” which was in turn generated by running “gcc -Wall implementation.c”) is “main.adb”. The other “main\*” files are output from the GNAT compiler (“gcc -S main.adb” and “gnatmake main.adb”). The remaining files are tests for code sections used in “implementation.c” (mostly in the “add_words” function).

(Incomplete) list of things not implemented:
Functions
Pointers and arrays
“Float” and other variable types
“For” and “do ... while” loops
The “switch case” statement
Almost all standard library functions
